      <p>This is my message to you after our first 'official' Eid together. This was even our first Ramadan together, and it flew! Although we spent so much of it running around, shopping, and zipping back and forth between Barking, I loved spending every cherished moment with you. Although we had our moments, I loved cuddling up to you after every Taraweeh. Although sometimes you really get on my nerves, I love you. 
      </p>
      <p>A great big thank you and a big hug my baby for always serving me suhoor, no matter what terms we were on. I thought to make it different this time. Instead of a poem, it's just a little message. But I hope you appreciate that it's on my own lovely website. I hope we have lots more Ramadans and Eids together in sha Allah and I can't wait to show you your gifts! May Allah make you the coolness of my eyes.</p>
      <p>Love, Nurul x</p>
